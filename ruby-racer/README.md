# Ruby Racer

I wrote the following terminal program in Ruby as a solo challenge on my fourth day of Phase 1 at Dev Bootcamp. This was an exercise in data structures and keeping track of state in a simple terminal application. I wound up having waaaay too much fun with it. 

To run, first run `bundle install` to ensure all required gems are installed. Then run `ruby runner.rb` from the command line.

Enjoy!
